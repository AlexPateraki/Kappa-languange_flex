# Kappa-languange
The project involves designing and implementing the initial stages of a compiler for the fictional programming language called Kappa.

The task is to create a source-to-source compiler, also known as a trans-compiler or transpiler, which takes the source code of a program written in the Kappa programming language as input and produces equivalent source code in another programming language, in this case, the well-known C programming language.

The project will be divided into two parts:  

-Implementation of a lexical analyzer for the Kappa language using the flex tool.    
-Implementation of a syntax analyzer (parser) for the Kappa language using the bison tool, which includes converting Kappa code into C code using bison actions.
The tools flex and bison will be utilized for the project, both of which are available as free software, along with the C programming language.  

Overall, the goal of the project is to build a transpiler that translates code written in the fictional language Kappa to equivalent code in C, by utilizing lexical and syntax analysis techniques.
